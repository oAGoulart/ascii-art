# ASCII Art Animation Algorithm: Using Object-Oriented Concepts in C

Implementation using Object-Oriented concepts, most of it is just structs emulating the functionalities of classes (mostly based on C++). e.g.: methods, constructors, and destructors. This is not a pure implementation of Object-Oriented Programming but rather an use of its concepts to try and understand it better.

Hope ya'll enjoy, if you have any contributions that you may want to add to this repo, contact me!
